Chromatic-Guitar-Tuner
======================

Chromatic Tuner Application for Guitars and other Instruments

Programmed in Processing2.0  (requires processing.org and minim.js library)

This program allows you to tune your guitar or other stringed instrument.  It takes input from the microphone.

â€¢ Notes on the oscilloscope function.
	The Red and Blue lines are the actual sound wave sampled at two different time points
  (they are sampled, separated by the frequency of the target string).
	They will overlap when the note is tuned.


The program finds the closest note to what it hears, and it's fully chromatic, you can tune to any note.
The Triangle arrows tell you to tune up or tune down, the green circle indicates it's close to in-tune.

On the right side is a Graphic EQ, centered on the note.
